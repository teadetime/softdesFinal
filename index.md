#  THIS IS THE MAIN PROJECT SITE



## Big Idea/Goal/What is this?/ Why did we do this? 
Quick and easily understandable explanation of what your project is all about. Consider including a narrative or example use case, e.g. via screenshots, video, or story boarding.

## User instructions/README
[View Readme](/README.md)
Information to help users download, install, and get started running your software (README rubric)

## Implementation information 
Code doesnâ€™t tell a story by itself. Use more effective methods such as flowcharts and architectural, class, or sequence diagrams to explain how your code works. You could consider including or linking to snippets of code to highlight a particularly crucial segment.

## Results 
Though the details will be different for each project, show off what your software can do! Screenshots and video are likely helpful. Include graphs or other data if appropriate.

## Software Impact Statement 
Reflect on the ethical considerations you made throughout the design process, starting with project ideation and the priorities you set for your team. You should think of all of the stakeholders that might be impacted by your project and unintended consequences of the deployment of your software in real world scenarios. Discuss strategies for mitigating these issues.

## Project evolution/narrative 
Tell an illustrative story about the process of creating your software, showing how it improved over time. This may draw upon what you learned from the two peer technical reviews and from the code review. Consider the use of screenshots or other tools to demonstrate how your project evolved.
