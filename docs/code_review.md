# COde Review Framing
1) **MVP**

   Our MVP is a very minimally automated scheduling assistant that helps you fill out you're schedule but doesn't necessarily build the best one. The MVP will accept lots of user input and make less decisions algorithmically. For each semester it will show you suggested courses that will be beneficial to your major and you will select them. Also no support for LOA or Study Away. This will be a command line tool.

2) **Stretch Goals for May 7** 
    
    Our stretch goal has all of the components of the MVP with a higher level of automation. It could generate a full rest of college schedule, as well as automatically make a full semester's course selection. It will make intelligent decisions like taking classes with less pre-reqs etc. This would also take into account LOA's and study away. This implementation also will have a richer graphical interface and will not be a command line tool. This implementation will also have methods to edit the course catalog to add more relevant data or will parse more accurate data from past years.
    
    
3) **Project Status:**

   We are currently diverting all of our efforts to building the algorithm. We are both developing on the same implementation of the algorithm. The next big hurdle revolves around user input, and data maintenance of the catalog. We also are unsure of the correct way to handle Concurrent and Coreqs in our program, overall we still need to implement parts of our algorithm so that it adheres to these rules and other graduation requirements.
