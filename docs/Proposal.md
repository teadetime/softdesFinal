# Proposal for An Olin Interactive Advidsor (Olinvisor)
### Intro
Olinvisor is a program that helps students understand their scheduling choices to make these decisions easier. 
This tool will allow users to see insights into what their schedule could, or might have to look like depending on some of their course decisions.
This tool also provides the ability to graphically view choices in a more conducive format than an excel spreadsheet. 
Another valuable aspect of this is it would allow students to see how well their choices go across concentrations at Olin so that they can avoid accidentally locking themselves into a certain path.

### Why we want to do this (learning/project goals)
* Provides a mathemtaical and algorithmic challenge of figuring out what options a student could take to reach a degree
* Does very real work, we both would be interested in using this and we imagine other would too
* Could be expanded to other schools and turn into a larger product and or project
* Combines differnet parts of our experience into an area that neither of us have worked in before
* Problem can be scaled up or down depending on availability and commitment

### Key Components/Dependencies
* Could be implemented in pygame MVC or tkinter
    * tKinter (Adi has experience from micro project)
    * PyGame  (Nathan based micro project in a pygame MVC)
* Course Requirements from Olin, spelled out well

### Risks
Main risks revolve around making the optimization algorithm of what classes should be taken when.
In addition figuring out a way to graphically display this data well could be really hard. 
Also making this effective compared to talking to an advisor is something that needs to be addressed.
Future terms may not be set in stone enough for this to provie any usable data.
