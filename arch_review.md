# Olinvisor, a scheduling program for Olin students
## Background and context 
The goal of this project is to make a semi-automated course scheduler for students. They will be able to input their current courses and other restraints (LOA, study away, etc) and their degree and recieve potential schedules they could take.
We plan to do this off of various information that we have access to:
* Olin course online catalgue (has CRN and credits etc, as well as degree requirements)
* This year's fall and spring offerings(to establish which semeseters courses are offered)

What information about your project does the audience need to participate fully in the technical review? You should share enough to make sure your audience understands the questions you are asking, but without going into unnecessary detail.

## Key questions
What do you want to learn from the review? What are the most important decisions your team is currently contemplating? Where might an outside perspective be most helpful? As you select key questions to ask during the review, bear in mind both the time limitations and background of your audience.

## Agenda for technical review session 
Be specific about how you plan to use your allotted time. What strategies will you use to communicate with your audience?

## Feedback form
Create a Google form that folks in the review will use to provide you with feedback or answers to various questions you pose to your audience. Since, at least for the first review, the time you have to present will be relatively short you should expect much of the feedback you get to come from this form rather than thoughts expressed orally during your session. Please create a feedback form tailored for your architectural review and share the link no less than 2 hours before class.
